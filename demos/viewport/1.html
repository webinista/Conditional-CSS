<h1>Career crossroads, culture and community</h1>

<p><img src="../images/lake.jpg" width="100%"  alt="Moottoritie - Highway"></a>My stretch of funemployment has given me some time to consider the themes of culture and community, particularly as they relate to the world of technology. It&#8217;s safe to say that I&#8217;m at a career crossroads. I&#8217;m deciding whether to continue in tech or whether to pivot into another career entirely.</p>
<p>What has brought things to a head, I think, is the realization that the tech industry can be isolating &#8212; maddeningly isolating &#8212; for a black woman.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m tired of being The Only. </p>

<p>Developers are awfully fond of the word &#8220;community.&#8221;  The word comes up again and again when discussing programming languages. We speak of a JavaScript community, a PHP community, or just generally, a developer community. But communities have norms and boundaries, usually unspoken. It&#8217;s those unspoken boundaries that I want to talk about.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not a secret that tech &#8212; and I&#8217;ll focus here on web developers and designers &#8212; is really white and really male. According to the A List Apart 2011 Survey (the latest year published), our industry is <a href="http://archive.aneventapart.com/alasurvey2011/00.html#eth">87.1% white</a> and <a href="http://archive.aneventapart.com/alasurvey2011/00.html#gen">81.6% male</a>. It&#8217;s also only 1.2% Black / African.<sup><a href="#n1-20130315">*</a></sup> Surveys have their biases, of course. But my experiences seem to prove this right. If there are 50 web developers in a room, there&#8217;s a <em>really</em> high likelihood that I will be the only woman <em>and</em> the only black person. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality">Intersectionality</a> is my career struggle. </p>

<p>People tend to befriend those who share their background, interests and outlook. I&#8217;m no exception. My friend circle is made up of hip-hop heads, sports fans, feminists, secularists, music addicts, art lovers, writers, cocktail enthusiasts, queer people and their allies, tomboys, and (oddly) librarians. Most of us are educated, sometimes highly. They also look more like me &#8212; tending towards women and people of color &#8212; than the attendees of your average technology gathering. </p>

<p>When I walk into a tech event, an interview, or any room full of strangers, I scan it for potential friends. People who match that pattern are the ones I feel most comfortable approaching. I even look and listen for signs: rainbow stickers on the laptop, Nike or Adidas high tops, or jokes that reference the music I listen to. When I don&#8217;t see people who match my pattern, I feel extremely out of place. </p>

<p>I think the same is true for most of us. And therein lies the problem, or my problem, anyway. Web developer communities often feel desperately homogeneous in terms of their culture.<sup><a href="#n2-20130315">**</a></sup> Peppering a talk with <em class="title movie">Star Wars</em> or punk music references is cool. But I&#8217;d feel more at home if there were more devs who could make Jay-Z jokes or catch my Drake references. I&#8217;m honestly not sure what to do about that. But I know it&#8217;s part of what keeps me from participating in these communities.</p>

<p>Why is this important? Because community connections and work relationships make or break careers. Indeed having a work friend actually <a href="http://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1053&#038;context=gradconf_hospitality">increases your work satisfaction</a>. If you can&#8217;t make friends in your industry or at your work place, what is the likelihood that you&#8217;ll remain in either?</p>

<p>Culture and community aren&#8217;t exclusively web developer problems, of course. Librarian culture and its community, for example, is heavily gendered and skews female. Again, I don&#8217;t even pretend to know how to fix this. But I can say that for me, this developer culture is a big reason why I don&#8217;t feel like I am a part of its community. </p>

<p class="footnote" id="n1-20130315">* I have trouble with that label because &#8220;African&#8221; is not the same as &#8220;black.&#8221; Black as an identity really only exists in contrast to white and most Africans don&#8217;t have to work with that issue. Kind of like how &#8220;Hispanic/Latino&#8221; doesn&#8217;t exist outside of the United States.</p>
<p class="footnote" id="n2-20130315">**Yeah, I realize the limits of this sentence once we step outside of a U.S. context.</p>

<h1>Math anxiety is real: on slaying my dragon and learning to love math*</h1>

<p>While working on my article last year about the <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/understanding-the-css-transforms-matrix/">CSS Transforms Matrix</a>, I had to re-visit some math that I hadn&#8217;t really touched since maybe 9th grade. In fact, I don&#8217;t actually remember learning it the first time. Amazingly, after a dedicated weekend of reading Wikipedia articles, I picked up enough to multiply matrices and explain it to someone else.</p>
<p>Consider that my first lightbulb moment.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve struggled with math since my days of long division, but not necessarily in the ways you might expect. I mean, my cousin taught me how to solve algebraic equations when I was 8. Typically, my #mathstruggle falls into one of two categories:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Simple mistakes:</b> for example, forgetting to carry the 1, or using a &#8211; instead of a +</li>
<li><b>Procedural mistakes:</b> mis-remembering precisely how to solve a problem.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#8217;ve made one or both of those mistakes so many times and in so many ways that eventually, my internal dialogue started to go like this: <q>Oh shit! Numbers. And not just numbers, but equations! Um okay. Seven times two is fourteen, and carry the one, and multiply 2 times 5 and add the one, then do that to the other side and OMG THE ANSWER IS A GINORMOUS FRACTION! THAT CAN&#8217;T BE RIGHT! <em>AND I&#8217;M SO STUPID AND WILL NEVER EVER GET MATH, LIKE EVER!</em></q> Sometimes this is capped by me sobbing and throwing my pencil.  </p>
<p>Getting so wound up served me well when it came to taking tests. I&#8217;d freak out about problem 3, spend 10 minutes getting cognitively overwhelmed by my anxiety, and another 10 trying to calm down enough to finish the test. As you might imagine, this did wonders for my math grades. And bad grades in math only reinforced my narrative about my ability to understand and do well at it.</p>
<p>Late last year, I read an article about the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/27/education/a-grueling-admissions-test-highlights-a-racial-divide.html?pagewanted=all">math successes of Asian-American students</a> in New York City&#8217;s schools. This quote is what stuck out for me.</p>
<blockquote cite=""><p>&#8220;Most of our parents don&#8217;t believe in &#8216;gifted,&#8217;&#8221; said Riyan Iqbal, 15, the son of Bangladeshi immigrants, as he and his friends &#8217; of Bengali, Korean and Indian descent &#8217; meandered toward the subway from the Bronx High School of Science one recent afternoon. &#8220;It&#8217;s all about hard work.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;d be my second lightbulb moment.</p>
<p>I was always one of those &#8216;gifted&#8217; kids growing up, despite my struggle with math. I never really worked hard at any subject. I just figured I just wasn&#8217;t naturally good at math in the same way I was naturally good at remembering dates and understanding cause-and-effect as you do in history class. It honestly never occurred to me that if I paid attention, did my homework, and sought extra help when necessary &#8212; y&#8217;know <em>worked hard</em> &#8212; that my grades would improve. Plus I kind of didn&#8217;t care about grades.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go back to that article on CSS Transforms. While researching it, I learned that transform matrices &#8212; math! &#8212; were intimately tied to computer graphics. There are scale and rotation transformations, but even the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_blur">Gaussian blur</a> can be explained by a transformation matrix. I mean math and computing go together like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackee_and_saltfish">ackee and saltfish</a> or gin and tonic.</p>
<p>Maybe that&#8217;s my third lightbulb moment. It&#8217;s certainly the one that sent me back to school. Yup. I am currently enrolled in an Introductory Algebra class at one of <a href="http://www.laccd.edu/">Los Angeles&#8217; community colleges</a>. Next up is Intermediate Algebra, followed by some introductory computer science classes. Whether I go all the way and get a second bachelor&#8217;s degree in computer science will depend greatly on how soon and what kind of employment I find. But this is the path I&#8217;m currently on.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s different is that I get it now. I still only sort of care about grades, but I see how math is cumulative. Basic skills are your foundation for advanced ones. Concepts compound each other. I see how it relates to my work. And I see my skills improving this time around because I took advice from a 15 year old named Riyan Iqbal and decided to work at it.</p>
<p class="footnote">* And by &#8220;love math,&#8221; I really mean &#8220;no longer weep and curl into a ball when I encounter math.&#8221;</p>
