I. Introduction
	A. About me
		1. Web developer
		2. Former member of the Opera Software Developer Relations team
		3. Now embarking on an entrepreneurial venture (translation: I'm a freelancer for hire)
		4. Note that it's my last talk for a long time and they should be honored
	B. About this talk
		1. Some of this is well-supported and familiar to you.
		2. Some of this is wildly experimental and supported in one or two browsers
		3. Take a look at what's now, what's new and what's next.
	C. What is "Conditional CSS"?
		1. A new way of looking at some of the things we already know and use.
		2. CSS features and DOM APIs that allow us to set the conditions under which a set of CSS rules should be applied.
		3. Several of the at-rules:
			a. @media
			b. @supports
			c. @viewport[3][4][13]
			d. @document - Experimental, only in Firefox
			e. @page if there's time.
II. @media: a recap
	A. Been around for ages
	B. Used to set styles for a particular medium: screen, print, projection, etc.
	C. Extended with media queries http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-mediaqueries/
		1. Basic syntax
		2. Simple screen + device-width example
		3. Orientation example: a. Use with an orientation change event?
		4. Aspect-ratio and device-aspect-ratio (what's the difference?)	
		5. Best practices: width breakpoints versus content breakpoints
		6. CSSOM [8]
	D. window.matchMedia()
		1. DOM/CSSOM API for interacting with media queries.
		2. Can conditionally add behavior based on its result 
		3. Polyfills and the like
			a. matchMedia.js available https://github.com/paulirish/matchMedia.js/
			b. YUI Gallery Module https://github.com/nzakas/yui3-gallery/tree/master/src/gallery-media
		4. Browser bugs[7]
		5. What about to conditionally load style sheets? [14]
III. @supports
		A. @-rule based CSS features
		B. window.CSS.supports() API
IV.  @viewport
		A. Viewport meta tag review
		B. CSS feature set in IE and Opera

IV. Detour into CSS Object Model maybe?: FLESH OUT THIS SECTION?

V. What's next?
	A. Fancier media queries: Look at Stu Cox' post roundup + include Mozilla and WebKit bugs
	B. @document, which is currently implemented in Firefox only.
	   	1. Was part of the Conditional CSS Rules spec, level 3 but moved to Level 4 
	   	2. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/@document
		3. Simple example
		4. More complex example using regexp();
	C. @regions - WebKit and Adobe
