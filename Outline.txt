I. Introduction
	A. About me
		1. Web developer
		2. Former member of the Opera Software Developer Relations team
		3. Now embarking on an entrepreneurial venture (translation: I'm a freelancer for hire)
		4. Note that it's my last talk for a long time and they should be honored
	B. About this talk
		1. Some of this is well-supported and familiar to you.
		2. Some of this is wildly experimental and supported in one or two browsers
		3. Take a look at what's now, what's new and what's next.
	C. What is "Conditional CSS"?
		1. A new way of looking at some of the things we already know and use.
		2. CSS features and DOM APIs that allow us to set the conditions under which a set of CSS rules should be applied.
		3. Several of the at-rules:
			@page
			@media
			@supports
			@document
			@regions[1] - WebKit-only, pushed by Adobe
			@namespace[2] - Might be too complex
		4. Also some associated CSS Object Model APIs
			a. window.matchMedia()
			b. window.CSS.supports(), which in Opera 12 was implemented using the old window.supportsCSS() syntax.
II. What's now:
	A. @page: a recap
		1. About as old as @media
		2. Used to modify margins, orphans, widows, and page breaks of a printed document
		3. Simple example (maybe add support for @page to this presentation?)
		4. More complex example that uses some other @rules inside of @page?

			https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/@page
	B. @media: a recap
		1. Been around for ages
		2. Used to set styles for a particular medium: screen, print, projection, etc.
		3. Extended with media queries http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-mediaqueries/
			a. Basic syntax
			b. Simple screen + device-width example
			c. Orientation example: a. Use with an orientation change event?
			d. Aspect-ratio and device-aspect-ratio (what's the difference?)	
			e. Best practices: width breakpoints versus content breakpoints
III. What's new:
	A. window.matchMedia()
		1. DOM/CSSOM API for interacting with media queries.
		2. Can conditionally add behavior based on its result 
	B. @supports
		1. @-rule based CSS features
		2. window.CSS.supports() API
	C. Detour into CSS Object Model: FLESH OUT THIS SECTION?

IV. What's next?
	A. Fancier media queries: Look at Stu Cox' post roundup + include Mozilla and WebKit bugs
	B. @document, which is currently implemented in Firefox only.
	   	1. Was part of the Conditional CSS Rules spec, level 3 but moved to Level 4 
	   	2. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/@document
		3. Simple example
		4. More complex example using regexp();
	C. @regions - WebKit and Adobe
